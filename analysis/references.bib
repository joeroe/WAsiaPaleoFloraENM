  abstract = {Species distribution models should provide conservation practioners with estimates of the spatial distributions of species requiring attention. These species are often rare and have limited known occurrences, posing challenges for creating accurate species distribution models. We tested four modeling methods (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, and Maxent) across 18 species with different levels of ecological specialization using six different sample size treatments and three different evaluation measures. Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and GARP) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species. Our results indicate that reasonable models can be made for some rare species, a result that should encourage conservationists to add distribution modeling to their toolbox.},

  abstract = {Aim Techniques that predict species potential distributions by combining observed occurrence records with environmental variables show much potential for application across a range of biogeographical analyses. Some of the most promising applications relate to species for which occurrence records are scarce, due to cryptic habits, locally restricted distributions or low sampling effort. However, the minimum sample sizes required to yield useful predictions remain difficult to determine. Here we developed and tested a novel jackknife validation approach to assess the ability to predict species occurrence when fewer than 25 occurrence records are available. Location Madagascar. Methods Models were developed and evaluated for 13 species of secretive leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus spp.) that are endemic to Madagascar, for which available sample sizes range from 4 to 23 occurrence localities (at 1 km2 grid resolution). Predictions were based on 20 environmental data layers and were generated using two modelling approaches: a method based on the principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) and a genetic algorithm (GARP). Results We found high success rates and statistical significance in jackknife tests with sample sizes as low as five when the Maxent model was applied. Results for GARP at very low sample sizes (less than c. 10) were less good. When sample sizes were experimentally reduced for those species with the most records, variability among predictions using different combinations of localities demonstrated that models were greatly influenced by exactly which observations were included. Main conclusions We emphasize that models developed using this approach with small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions that have similar environmental conditions to where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting actual limits to the range of a species. The jackknife validation approach proposed here enables assessment of the predictive ability of models built using very small sample sizes, although use of this test with larger sample sizes may lead to overoptimistic estimates of predictive power. Our analyses demonstrate that geographical predictions developed from small numbers of occurrence records may be of great value, for example in targeting field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations and species.},

Because, sampling species’ distributions is costly, we explored sample size needs for accurate modeling for three predictive modeling methods via re-sampling of data for well-sampled species, and developed curves of model improvement with increasing sample size. In general, under a coarse surrogate model, and machine-learning methods, average success rate at predicting occurrence of a species at a location, or accuracy, was 90\% of maximum within ten sample points, and was near maximal at 50 data points. However, a fine surrogate model and logistic regression model had significantly lower rates of increase in accuracy with increasing sample size, reaching similar maximum accuracy at 100 data points. The choice of environmental variables also produced unpredictable effects on accuracy over the range of sample sizes on the logistic regression method, while the machine-learning method had robust performance throughout. Examining correlates of model performance across species, extent of geographic distribution was the only significant ecological factor.},

  abstract = {A wide range of modelling algorithms is used by ecologists, conservation practitioners, and others to predict species ranges from point locality data. Unfortunately, the amount of data available is limited for many taxa and regions, making it essential to quantify the sensitivity of these algorithms to sample size. This is the first study to address this need by rigorously evaluating a broad suite of algorithms with independent presence–absence data from multiple species and regions. We evaluated predictions from 12 algorithms for 46 species (from six different regions of the world) at three sample sizes (100, 30, and 10 records). We used data from natural history collections to run the models, and evaluated the quality of model predictions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). With decreasing sample size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across species and between models. Novel modelling methods that incorporate both interactions between predictor variables and complex response shapes (i.e. GBM, MARS-INT, BRUTO) performed better than most methods at large sample sizes but not at the smallest sample sizes. Other algorithms were much less sensitive to sample size, including an algorithm based on maximum entropy (MAXENT) that had among the best predictive power across all sample sizes. Relative to other algorithms, a distance metric algorithm (DOMAIN) and a genetic algorithm (OM-GARP) had intermediate performance at the largest sample size and among the best performance at the lowest sample size. No algorithm predicted consistently well with small sample size (n {$<$} 30) and this should encourage highly conservative use of predictions based on small sample size and restrict their use to exploratory modelling.},

Which flow routing algorithms are preferable for application in vegetation ecology? Location: Forests in three different regions of the Czech Republic. Methods: We used vegetation data from 521 georeferenced plots, recently sampled in a wide range of forest communities. From a digital elevation model, we calculated 11 variations of TWI for each plot with 11 different flow routing algorithms. We evaluated the performance of differently calculated TWI by (1) Spearman rank correlation with average Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture, (2) Mantel correlation coefficient between dissimilarities of species composition and dissimilarities of TWI and (3) the amount of variation in species composition explained by canonical correspondence analysis. Results: The choice of flow routing algorithm had a considerable effect on the performance of TWI. Correlation with Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture, Mantel correlation coefficient and explained variation doubled when the appropriate algorithm was used. In all regions, multiple flow routing algorithms performed best, while single flow routing algorithms performed worst. Conclusions: We recommend the multiple flow routing algorithms of Quinn et al. and Freeman for application in vegetation ecology.}

Plant diversity is expected to have a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity in these ranges. However, there has been a lack of high-resolution data to assess how fine-scale environmental variation structures changes in plant communities across these ranges. We calculated species richness and corrected weighted endemism over 659 quadrats (each 400\,m2) and investigated their spatial distribution across BIFs in relation to 1\,m resolution variables (microtopographic heterogeneity, solar radiation and topographic wetness) using geographically weighted regression. Microtopographic heterogeneity was most strongly related to richness and endemism, but this association was spatially variable at short distances across BIFs: relationships were negative or weakly positive on north-eastern range sections, whereas positive associations became progressively stronger further south and west on central, western and southern sections. Negative solar radiation-plant associations were reduced in these areas, likely because metre-scale surface variation moderates insolation. Topographic wetness-plant associations were negative on BIFs, but positive on the surrounding plains. The presence of fine-scale, geographically variant heterogeneity-diversity relationships in other locations would be difficult to detect if high-resolution environmental data are not used, with the implication that conservation decision-making may be compromised. Given climatic warming predicted for south-western Australia and other regions globally, a similar approach to that applied here can contribute to conservation by identifying locations likely to act as micro-buffers against warming.}

We also calculated Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), slope angle and slope aspect from Global Digital Elevation Model. Results and Conclusion Second-order mean of BI had an important effect on the occurrence of target trees species. TWI was an important variable for Prosopis spp. and B. retama, whereas slope angle was important for R. girolae and B. retama. In addition, the occurrence of R. girolae was affected by second-order variance of BI and slope aspect; and the presence of B. retama was affected by second-order contrast of BI. All the variables that had important effects on the occurrence of tree species provide environmental information about their different habitat requirements; therefore, our findings indicate that the remote sensing data are reliable to derive indicators of tree species presence in our study area.},

We suggest that we need to revisit the conceptual framework and ecological assumptions on which the relationship between species distributions and environment is based. We present a simple conceptual framework to examine the selection of environmental predictors and data resolution scales. These vary widely in recent papers, with light inconsistently included in the models. Focusing on light as a necessary component of plant SDMs, we briefly review its dependence on aspect and slope and existing knowledge of its influence on plant distribution. Differences in light regimes between north- and south-facing aspects in temperate latitudes can produce differences in temperature equivalent to moves 200 km polewards. Local topography may create refugia that are not recognized in many climate change SDMs using coarse-scale data. We argue that current assumptions about the selection of predictors and data resolution need further testing. Application of these ideas can clarify many issues of scale, extent and choice of predictors, and potentially improve the use of SDMs for climate change modelling of biodiversity.},

We also tested how the respective influence of these variables in the models is linked to different ecological and functional species characteristics. Location The Western Alps, Switzerland. Methods With four different modelling techniques, we built models for 115 plant species using topo-climatic variables alone and then topo-climatic variables plus each of the seven edaphic variables, one at a time. We evaluated the contribution of each edaphic variable by assessing the change in predictive power of the model. In a second step, we evaluated the importance of the two edaphic variables that yielded the largest increase in predictive power in one final set of models for each species. Third, we explored the change in predictive power and the importance of variables across plant functional groups. Finally, we assessed the influence of the edaphic predictors on the prediction of community composition by stacking the models for all species and comparing the predicted communities with the observed community. Results Among the set of edaphic variables studied, pH and nitrogen content showed the highest contributions to improvement of the predictive power of the models, as well as the predictions of community composition. When considering all topo-climatic and edaphic variables together, pH was the second most important variable after degree-days. The changes in model results caused by edaphic predictors were dependent on species characteristics. The predictions for the species that have a low specific leaf area, and acidophilic preferences, tolerating low soil pH and high humus content, showed the largest improvement by the addition of pH and nitrogen in the model. Conclusions pH was an important predictor variable for explaining species distribution and community composition of the mountain plants considered in our study. pH allowed more precise predictions for acidophilic species. This variable should not be neglected in the construction of species distribution models in areas with contrasting edaphic conditions.},

  abstract = {Aims The choice of environmental predictor variables in correlative models of plant species distributions (hereafter SDMs) is crucial to ensure predictive accuracy and model realism, as highlighted in multiple earlier studies. Because variable selection is directly related to a model's capacity to capture important species' environmental requirements, one would expect an explicit prior consideration of all ecophysiologically meaningful variables. For plants, these include temperature, water, soil nutrients, light, and in some cases, disturbances and biotic interactions. However, the set of predictors used in published correlative plant SDM studies varies considerably. No comprehensive review exists of what environmental predictors are meaningful, available (or missing) and used in practice to predict plant distributions. Contributing to answer these questions is the aim of this review. Methods We carried out an extensive, systematic review of recently published plant SDM studies (years 2010--2015; n = 200) to determine the predictors used (and not used) in the models. We additionally conducted an in-depth review of SDM studies in selected journals to identify temporal trends in the use of predictors (years 2000--2015; n = 40). Results A large majority of plant SDM studies neglected several ecophysiologically meaningful environmental variables, and the number of relevant predictors used in models has stagnated or even declined over the last 15 yr. Conclusions Neglecting ecophysiologically meaningful predictors can result in incomplete niche quantification and can thus limit the predictive power of plant SDMs. Some of these missing predictors are already available spatially or may soon become available (e.g. soil moisture). However, others are not yet easily obtainable across whole study extents (e.g. soil pH and nutrients), and their development should receive increased attention. We conclude that more effort should be made to build ecologically more sound plant SDMs. This requires a more thorough rationale for the choice of environmental predictors needed to meet the study goal, and the development of missing ones. The latter calls for increased collaborative effort between ecological and geo-environmental sciences.},

  abstract = {Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a broadly used tool in different fields of plant ecology. Despite the importance of edaphic conditions in determining the niche of terrestrial plant species, edaphic data have rarely been included in ENMs of plant species perhaps because such data are not available for many regions. Recently, edaphic data has been made available at a global scale allowing its potential inclusion and evaluation on ENM performance for plant species. Here, we take advantage of such data and address the following main questions: What is the influence of distinct predictor variables (e.g. climatic vs edaphic) on different ENM algorithms? and what is the relationship between the performance of different predictors and geographic characteristics of species? We used 125 plant species distributed over the Neotropical region to explore the effect on ENMs of using edaphic data available from the SoilGrids database and its combination with climatic data from the CHELSA database. In addition, we related these different predictor variables to geographic characteristics of the target species and different ENM algorithms. The use of different predictors (climatic, edaphic, and both) significantly affected model performance and spatial complexity of the predictions. We showed that the use of global edaphic plus climatic variables generates ENMs with similar or better accuracy compared to those constructed only with climate variables. Moreover, the performance of models considering these different predictors, separately or jointly, was related to geographic properties of species records, such as number and distribution range. The large geographic extent, the variability of environments and the different species' geographical characteristics considered here allowed us to demonstrate that global edaphic data adds useful information for plant ENMs. This is particularly valuable for studies of species that are distributed in regions where more detailed information on soil properties is poor or does not even exist.},

Increased reliance on soil data calls for easily accessible data layers providing continuous soil predictions worldwide. Although SoilGrids provides a potentially useful source of predicted soil data for biogeographic applications, its accuracy for estimating the soil characteristics experienced by individuals in small-scale populations is unclear. We used a biogeographic sampling approach to obtain soil samples from 212 sites across the midwestern and eastern United States, sampling only at sites where there was a population of one of the 22 species in Lobelia sect. Lobelia. We analyzed six physical and chemical characteristics in our samples and compared them with predicted values from SoilGrids. Across all sites and species, soil texture variables (clay, silt, sand) were better predicted by SoilGrids (R2: .25--.46) than were soil chemistry variables (carbon and nitrogen, R2 {$\leq$} .01; pH, R2: .19). While SoilGrids predictions rarely matched actual field values for any variable, we were able to recover qualitative patterns relating species means and population-level plant characteristics to soil texture and pH. Rank order of species mean values from SoilGrids and direct measures were much more consistent for soil texture (Spearman rS = .74--.84; all p {$<$} .0001) and pH (rS = .61, p = .002) than for carbon and nitrogen (p {$>$} .35). Within the species L. siphilitica, a significant association, known from field measurements, between soil texture and population sex ratios could be detected using SoilGrids data, but only with large numbers of sites.

Based on an original spatial resolution of 0{$\cdot$}5 m, we generated DEM-derived variables at 1, 2 and 4 m spatial resolutions, applying a Gaussian Pyramid. Their associations with local climatic factors, measured by sensors (direct and ambient air temperature, air humidity and soil moisture) as well as ecological indicators derived from species composition, were assessed with multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) and mixed models (GLMM). Specific VHR DEM-derived variables showed significant associations with climatic factors. In addition to slope, aspect and curvature, the underused wetness and ruggedness indices modelled measured ambient humidity and soil moisture, respectively. Remarkably, spatial resolution of VHR DEM-derived variables had a significant influence on models' strength, with coefficients of determination decreasing with coarser resolutions or showing a local optimum with a 2 m resolution, depending on the variable considered. These results support the relevance of using multi-scale DEM variables to provide surrogates for important climatic variables such as humidity, moisture and temperature, offering suitable alternatives to direct measurements for evolutionary ecology studies at a local scale.},

  abstract = {Zohary and Hopf coined the term `founder crops' to refer to a specific group of eight plants, namely three cereals (einkorn, emmer and barley), four legumes (lentil, pea, bitter vetch and chickpea), and a fibre/oil crop (flax), that founded early Neolithic agriculture in southwest Asia. Zohary considered these taxa as the first cultivated and domesticated species, as well as those that agricultural communities exploited and eventually spread to Europe and other regions. As a result, these eight species soon become the hallmark of the Neolithic plant-based subsistence. However, the `founder crops' concept was defined at the end of the 1980s, when the development of agriculture was considered a rapid event, and therefore, terms like domestication, agriculture and plant cultivation were used interchangeably in the literature. The aim of this paper is thus to revisit concept of the `Neolithic founder crops'. Through a critical review of the archaeobotanical evidence gathered in the last 40~years, we evaluate the relative contribution of the `eight founder crop' species to the plant-based subsistence across different periods of the southwest Asian Neolithic. We conclude that multiple groups of `founder' species could be defined depending on whether one seeks to represent the most exploited plants of the Neolithic period, the first cultivated and domesticated crops, or the species that agricultural communities cultivated and eventually spread to Europe. Improved understanding of Neolithic plant-based subsistence in general, and agriculture in particular, will be attained by moving beyond conventional narratives and exploring the evolutionary history of plants other than the original `founder' species.},

Most species distribution modelling techniques produce continuous suitability predictions, but many real applications (e.g. reserve design, species invasion and climate change impact assessment) and model evaluations require binary outputs, and thresholds are needed for these transformations. Although there are many threshold selection methods for presence/absence data, it is unclear whether these are suitable for presence-only data. In this paper, we investigate mathematically and empirically which of the existing threshold selection methods can be used confidently with presence-only data. Location We used real spatially explicit environmental data derived from the western part of the state of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, and simulated species distributions within this area. Methods Thirteen existing threshold selection methods were investigated mathematically to see whether the same threshold can be produced using either presence/absence data or presence-only data. We further adopted a simulation approach, created many virtual species with differing prevalences in a real landscape in south-eastern Australia, generated data sets with different proportions of pseudo-absences, built eight types of models with four modelling techniques, and investigated the behaviours of four threshold selection methods in these situations. Results Three threshold selection methods were not affected by pseudo-absences, including max SSS (which is based on maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity), the prevalence of model training data and the mean predicted value of a set of random points. Max SSS produced higher sensitivity in most cases and higher true skill statistic and kappa in many cases than the other methods. The other methods produced different thresholds from presence-only data to those determined from presence/absence data. Main conclusions Max SSS is a promising method for threshold selection when only presence data are available.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is widely used in ecology and conservation. Currently, the most available data for SDM are species presence-only records (available through digital databases). There have been many studies comparing the performance of alternative algorithms for modeling presence-only data. Among these, a 2006 paper from Elith and colleagues has been particularly influential in the field, partly because they used several novel methods (at the time) on a global data set that included independent presence--absence records for model evaluation. Since its publication, some of the algorithms have been further developed and new ones have emerged. In this paper, we explore patterns in predictive performance across methods, by reanalyzing the same data set (225 species from six different regions) using updated modeling knowledge and practices. We apply well-established methods such as generalized additive models and MaxEnt, alongside others that have received attention more recently, including regularized regressions, point-process weighted regressions, random forests, XGBoost, support vector machines, and the ensemble modeling framework biomod. All the methods we use include background samples (a sample of environments in the landscape) for model fitting. We explore impacts of using weights on the presence and background points in model fitting. We introduce new ways of evaluating models fitted to these data, using the area under the precision-recall gain curve, and focusing on the rank of results. We find that the way models are fitted matters. The top method was an ensemble of tuned individual models. In contrast, ensembles built using the biomod framework with default parameters performed no better than single moderate performing models. Similarly, the second top performing method was a random forest parameterized to deal with many background samples (contrasted to relatively few presence records), which substantially outperformed other random forest implementations. We find that, in general, nonparametric techniques with the capability of controlling for model complexity outperformed traditional regression methods, with MaxEnt and boosted regression trees still among the top performing models. All the data and code with working examples are provided to make this study fully reproducible.},

  abstract = {The random forest (RF) algorithm is an ensemble of classification or regression trees and is widely used, including for species distribution modelling (SDM). Many researchers use implementations of RF in the R programming language with default parameters to analyse species presence-only data together with `background' samples. However, there is good evidence that RF with default parameters does not perform well for such `presence-background' modelling. This is often attributed to the disparity between the number of presence and background samples, also known as 'class imbalance', and several solutions have been proposed. Here, we first set the context: the background sample should be large enough to represent all environments in the region. We then aim to understand the drivers of poor performance of RF when models are fitted to presence-only species data alongside background samples. We show that 'class overlap' (where both classes occur in the same environment) is an important driver of poor performance, alongside class imbalance. Class overlap can even degrade performance for presence--absence data. We explain, test and evaluate suggested solutions. Using simulated and real presence-background data, we compare performance of default RF with other weighting and sampling approaches. Our results demonstrate clear evidence of improvement in the performance of RFs when techniques that explicitly manage imbalance are used. We show that these either limit or enforce tree depth. Without compromising the environmental representativeness of the sampled background, we identify approaches to fitting RF that ameliorate the effects of imbalance and overlap and allow excellent predictive performance. Understanding the problems of RF in presence-background modelling allows new insights into how best to fit models, and should guide future efforts to best deal with such data.},

The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2.?In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3.?When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model?s predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4.?Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10?000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.}

To date, studies focus on the Mediterranean zone. This paper adopts similar approaches to examine Epipalaeolithic to Neolithic faunal data from 16 sites in the steppic Jordanian Azraq Basin. Results here reveal very different trends. Large game, mainly equids, fluctuate throughout the Epipalaeolithic, due to climatic conditions and available water/vegetation. Cattle thrive in the Azraq oasis, showing no decline in the Late Epipalaeolithic. Gazelle exploitation is predominant and sustainable throughout the Epipalaeolithic, even at Kharaneh IV and Wadi Jilat 6 `megasites'. However, PPNB assemblages from the limestone steppe show intensive game exploitation resulting from longer-stay settlement. The focused gazelle-hunting camp at Dhuweila in the basalt desert also shows pressure from indiscriminate culling impacting herd demography, interpreted as providing meat for onwards exchange. Human impacts on steppe fauna appear both local and in many cases short-term, unlike the large-game suppression reported from west of the Rift Valley. Resource pressures and game over-kill, whether population-driven or otherwise, are not currently apparent east of the Jordan River.}

SDM methods could be more broadly applied than they currently are to address research questions in archaeology and paleoanthropology. Specifically, SDM can be used to hindcast paleodistributions of species and ecological communities (paleo-SDM) for time periods and locations of prehistoric human occupation. Paleo-SDM may be a powerful tool for understanding human prehistory if used to hindcast the distributions of plants, animals and ecological communities that were key resources for prehistoric humans and to use this information to reconstruct the resource landscapes (paleoscapes) of prehistoric people. Components of the resource paleoscape include species (game animals, food plants), habitats, and geologic features and landforms associated with stone materials for tools, pigments, and so forth. We first review recent advances in SDM as it has been used to hindcast paleodistributions of plants and animals in the field of paleobiology. We then compare the paleo-SDM approach to paleoenvironmental reconstructions modeled from zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical records, widely used in archaeology and paleoanthropology. Next, we describe the less well developed but promising approach of using paleo-SDM methods to reconstruct resource paleoscapes. We argue that paleo-SDM offers an explicitly deductive strategy that generates spatial predictions grounded in strong theoretical understandings of the relation between species, habitat distributions and environment. Because of their limited sampling of space and time, archaeobiological records may be better suited for paleo-SDM validation than directly for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. We conclude by discussing the data requirements, limitations and potential for using predictive modeling to reconstruct resource paleoscapes. There is a need for improved paleoclimate models, improved paleoclimate proxy and species paleodistribution data for model validation, attention to scale issues, and rigorous modeling methods including mechanistic models.}

Comparison of the expected prevalence of a resource in the landscape with actual archaeological presence of the same resource can provide a metric for assessing resource choice in prehistory. However, the palaeoenvironmental data that would allow resource choice to be evaluated in this way are rarely available. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) techniques allow independent palaeoenvironmental datasets to be computed, which when compared to actual species' presence at sites as attested by archaeological datasets, can provide data on resource choice. Following recent calls for SDM to be applied more widely in archaeological contexts, we outline a simple method for predicting the presence of plant species in prehistory using modern analogues and palaeoclimatic datasets. These modelled distributions provide an independent dataset for comparison with archaeological data, thus providing a window into human resource choice in prehistory. We outline the method with specific reference to the transition from foraging to farming in the Neolithic of Central Anatolia, but the method could be applied to any period or region. We have used exclusively open source data and provided all code in our online supplementary materials, so that our method can be utilized by researchers interested in human resource choice in any region of the world and any period.}

We estimate the contribution of multiple environmental parameters on the explanation of variation in abundance of cattle remains from archaeological sites, and find that annual precipitation and maximum annual temperature are significant predictors of abundance. We then formulate, test, and confirm a hypothesis that states the process of cattle domestication involves a change in the types of environmental ranges in which cattle exploitation occurred by applying a species distribution model to presence-only data of wild and domestic cattle. Our results show that there is an expansion of cattle rearing in more temperate environments, which is a defining characteristic of the European early Neolithic.}

Yet, separating the effects of climate-driven and human-induced changes in prey species abundances remains challenging, particularly during the Late Upper Paleolithic, a period marked by rapid climate change and marked ecosystem transformation. To disentangle the effects of climate and hunter-gatherer populations on animal prey species during the period, we synthesize disparate paleoclimate records, zooarchaeological data, and archaeological data using ecological methods and theory to test to what extent climate and anthropogenic impacts drove broad changes in human subsistence observed in the Late Upper Paleolithic zooarchaeological records. We find that the observed changes in faunal assemblages during the European Late Upper Paleolithic are consistent with climate-driven animal habitat shifts impacting the natural abundances of high-ranked prey species on the landscape rather than human-induced resource depression. The study has important implications for understanding how past climate change impacted and structured the diet and demography of human populations and can serve as a baseline for considerations of resilience and adaptation in the present.},

The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950--2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soils are widely recognized as a non-renewable natural resource and as biophysical carbon sinks. As such, there is a growing requirement for global soil information. Although several global soil information systems already exist, these tend to suffer from inconsistencies and limited spatial detail. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present SoilGrids1km--a global 3D soil information system at 1 km resolution--containing spatial predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard depths): soil organic carbon (g kg-1), soil pH, sand, silt and clay fractions (\%), bulk density (kg m-3), cation-exchange capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments (\%), soil organic carbon stock (t ha-1), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology, and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed using 5-fold cross-validation were between 23-51\%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1) weak relationships between soil properties/classes and explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated as new input data become available.

Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

Here we present PaleoClim, a free database of downscaled paleoclimate outputs at 2.5-minute resolution ({\textasciitilde}5 km at equator) that includes surface temperature and precipitation estimates from snapshot-style climate model simulations using HadCM3, a version of the UK Met Office Hadley Centre General Circulation Model. As of now, the database contains climatic data for three key time periods spanning from 3.3 to 0.787 million years ago: the Marine Isotope Stage 19 (MIS19) in the Pleistocene ({\textasciitilde}787 ka), the mid-Pliocene Warm Period ({\textasciitilde}3.264-3.025 Ma), and MIS M2 in the Late Pliocene ({\textasciitilde}3.3 Ma).}

  abstract = {This review and synthesis weaves various multiproxy data into a single coherent narrative for the latest Pleistocene--Holocene paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic evolution of the Black Sea, Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea. This narrative, referred to as the ``Outflow Hypothesis'' rests on several key observations and interpretations which are incompatible with the suggestion that the post-LGM reconnection of the Black Sea basin to the global ocean occurred as a catastrophic flood. The widespread occurrence of sub-storm-wavebase uppermost Pleistocene to lower Holocene sediments across the southwestern Black Sea shelf at elevations as shallow as -78~m shows that the level of the Neoeuxine Lake (today's Black Sea) between 12.3~cal~ka and 9.5~cal~ka was high enough to spill outward into the Marmara Sea over the shallow sill in the southern Strait of Bosphorus (-37~m today). Southwest-prograded clinoforms immediately south of the strait in the northeastern Marmara Sea record the development of an early Holocene (11.1--10.2~cal~ka) mid-shelf delta ({$\Delta$}1) showing {\textasciitilde}3.3~km of aggressive progradation while its topset-to-foreset break climbed 8--9~m into a rising Marmara Sea. A streamlined south-prograded barform in the throat of the strait and giant megaflutes along its thalweg confirm the vigorous outflow from the early Holocene Neoeuxine Lake required to explain the climbing {$\Delta$}1 lobe. Multiproxy data from the northeastern Marmara Sea and southwestern Black Sea shelves indicate that the post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) reconnection of the Black Sea with the eastern Mediterranean occurred in a gradual fashion: first, at {\textasciitilde}10.2~cal~ka, a salt wedge lifted the brackish outflow off the floor of the Strait of Bosphorus terminating {$\Delta$}1 progradation; second, a more persistent density underflow introduced enough seawater strontium into the Black Sea to be taken up in mollusc shells by {\textasciitilde}9.5~cal~ka, and finally a range of euryhaline marine organisms replaced lacustrine faunas when salinity levels became favourable by {\textasciitilde}7.5~cal~ka. The onset of sapropel M1 deposition across the Marmara Sea followed the breach of the Strait of Dardanelles at 13.8~cal~ka when, as originally suggested by other researchers, nutrient-rich highly saline Mediterranean waters forced lower density relict lacustrine waters to the surface and then out through the Strait of Dardanelles, initiating water-column stratification. Once the low-salinity cap was expelled, the deep waters of the fully saline Marmara Sea remained stagnant and sapropel accumulation continued. The onset of outflow from the Neoeuxine Lake at 11.1~cal~ka re-established water-column stratification, induced effective deep circulation across the Marmara Sea, and created a low salinity lid across the northern Aegean Sea, initiating sapropel S1 deposition in that area.}

  abstract = {Mammalian body size diminution across the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition in the southern Levant has been much researched, with special focus on gazelle in Levantine Mediterranean zones. Explanations of body size diminutions in those cases include temperature increase and anthropogenic factors. This study examines body size shifts in three mammalian taxa -- Gazella (gazelle), Lepus (hare) and Vulpes (fox) -- between 24,000--7500~cal BP, in the steppic Azraq Basin of northeast Jordan. Osteometrics derive from 19 archaeological sites through the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene sequence. We use a `Z-score' index of relative body size, and time-series analyses, to track body size shifts. All three taxa show relatively larger body size in the Late Pleistocene compared to the Early Holocene, with smallest Late Pleistocene sizes seen between 12,000--11,500~cal BP, during the Younger Dryas. While gazelles and hare recover size in our Early Holocene samples, they both show smaller sizes after 9000~cal BP. Similarity in size trends leads us to reject the influence of anthropogenic factors alone, in favour of ecological and climatic factors. We attribute the sharp size decrease in gazelles in the Late Neolithic, 9000--7500~cal BP, to inter-specific size change, and the addition of a smaller Arabian species better adapted to the warmer arid post 8.2 kya conditions. Patterns for fox, albeit on small sample sizes, also hint at species turnover but in the Late Pleistocene. For hare, we track size decrease between the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene as possible intra-specific diminution. Combined results argue for mammalian taxa experiencing complex responses to shifting ecological conditions in the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene. Body size trends in the Azraq Basin appear counter to the expectations of Bergmann's rule of thermoregulation. We propose instead that forage conditions, and resource availability and limitations are better fit drivers of mammalian body size adaptations and turnover (including species distribution shifts) in this semi-arid case study region.}

Early Epipalaeolithic sites are common in the limestone steppe region of eastern Jordan but have yielded only a handful of caprine bones that cannot be identified to species level and few faunal remains from excavated Late Epipalaeolithic sites have been reported. Analysis of animal bone from Shubayqa 1 suggests a significant population of wild sheep could be found concentrated in the basalt desert environment of eastern Jordan during the Late Pleistocene, especially where higher rainfall over the Jebel Druze provided more water. A population of wild sheep was still present in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A when the nearby site of Shubayqa 6 was occupied. Hunting of diverse, locally available resources including wild sheep at the end of the Pleistocene illustrates the flexible and adaptive exploitation strategies that hunter-forager groups engaged in. This provides further evidence to the increasing body of data showing the creative and opportunistic approach of terminal Pleistocene groups allowing continued occupation even in more marginal environments in a period of environmental change.}

If climate limits the geographic ranges of species, then the climate envelope can be used to predict which ones will occur together in a palaeofauna or to reconstruct palaeoclimate based on the species found in a fossil site. We evaluated these possibilities using ten living mammal species, four that are now found in cold climates (Alopex lagopus, Lemmus lemmus, Ovibos moschatus and Rangifer tarandus), three that are now found in warm climates (Crocuta crocuta, Panthera leo and Hippopotamus amphibius) and three that are broadly spread through temperate climates (Arvicola terrestris, Cervus elaphus and Sus scrofa). The WorldClim data set of 19 climatic variables was used to characterise climate distributions for the ten species. Out of the 45 possible pairings of the ten species, 22 pairs have geographic ranges that do not overlap, but only 12 pairs have climatic envelopes that do not overlap. We looked at 22 palaeofaunas from the British Quaternary palaeofauna: 44\% of them had species whose climatic envelopes do not overlap today (these are climatically `non-analogue' or `disharmonious' faunas), whereas 82\% of the faunas had species whose geographic ranges do not overlap (these are geographically `non-analogue' faunas). The `index of disharmony' (IR) was IR=0.38 when geographic non-overlap was used as a criterion (higher than in similar aged North American faunas) but only IR=0.12 when climatic non-overlap was used. A maximum-likelihood function was used to estimate the most probable climate for the 22 palaeofaunas based on the modern climatic distribution of the ten species. The reconstructions were generally compatible with other quantitative estimates of palaeoclimate at the same sites.}

To this end, we compiled the most comprehensive data set on the distribution of this species during the Last Interglacial optimum (MIS 5e) available to date. This was used to calibrate a palaeo-species distribution model, and analyse variable importance at continental and local scales. Location Europe and Irano-Turanian region (20{$^\circ$} N to 70{$^\circ$} N, 10{$^\circ$} W to 70{$^\circ$} E). Methods We used archaeological records and palaeoclimatic and topographic predictors to calibrate a model based on an ensemble of generalized linear models fitted with different combinations of predictors and weighted background data. Area under the curve scores computed by leave-one-out were used to assess variable importance at the continental scale, while local regression combined with recursive partition trees was used to assess variable importance at the local scale. Results Annual rainfall and winter temperatures were the most important predictors at the continental scale, while topography and summer rainfall defined habitat suitability at the local scale. The highest habitat suitability scores were observed along the Mediterranean coastlines. Mountain ranges and continental plains showed low habitat suitability values. Main conclusions The model results confirmed that abiotic drivers played an important role in shaping Neanderthals distribution during the Last Interglacial. The high suitability of the Mediterranean coastlines and the low suitability values of most sites at the northern and eastern distribution limits (Germany, Hungary, Ukraine) challenge the notion of Neanderthals as a species with preference for colder environments.}

The Neanderthals' paleoecology and distribution has been extensively studied in Europe where the species originated. However, very little is known about their paleoecology in south-western Asia. Here, we employed species distribution modelling and 45 Middle Palaeolithic (c. 200,000--40,000~years BCE) sites location associated with fossil and/or lithic artefacts made by the Neanderthals to examine the expansion of the Neanderthals on the Iranian Plateau in south-western Asia. We estimated the niche overlap between Neanderthals and wild goat, wild sheep and Persian gazelle by modelling their past distribution using 200, 143 and 110 occurrence records respectively. The results show that Neanderthals had highest niche overlap with wild goat in the study area. This analysis revealed that the most suitable Neanderthals' habitats in south-western Asia were located in the Zagros Mountains stretches from north-western and western and some isolated patches in the central parts of the Iranian Plateau. The annual precipitation and maximum temperature of the warmest month were the most important predictor of the species' distribution. This finding shows that the southern edge of the Neanderthals distribution was limited by warm summer. Our results provide important information for future field investigations and excavations in the area.},

We examine the Middle Paleolithic archaeological record of a naturally constrained region of Western Europe between 82,000 and 60,000~years ago using ecological niche modeling methods. Evaluations of ecological niche estimations, in both geographic and environmental dimensions, indicate that 70,000~years ago the range of suitable habitats exploited by these Neanderthal populations contracted and shifted. These ecological niche dynamics are the result of groups continuing to occupy habitual territories that were characterized by new environmental conditions during Marine Isotope Stage 4. The development of original cultural adaptations permitted this territorial stability.},

  abstract = {Between 22ka and 9ka ago, after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and during the transition to the Holocene, mobile hunter-gatherer populations, differentiated by their stone tool assemblages, periodically dispersed and contracted across Europe. It is well understood that climate played an important role in human distributions and population sizes during the post-LGM Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, but the question remains as to whether increasing population sizes drove early human dispersal. Here, using a spatiotemporal species distribution model to infer the fundamental and potential human climatic niche space of Late Upper Paleolithic, Final Paleolithic and Early Mesolithic Europe, and hypotheses derived from the Ideal Distribution Model, we test i) how changes in climate affected the size and extent of the projected potential human niche space, ii) for effects of changes in size of projected potential niche on regional human population sizes, iii) whether increasing human population sizes drove human dispersal into less climatically suitable habitats, and iv) whether populations associated with different high-order material culture groupings (macro-level technocomplexes) occupied different climatic spaces. We find that changes in climate correlate strongly with the size and extent of the projected potential human niche space, that increases in the projected human niche space correlate with increases in human population, that human population size is just beginning to become large enough to influence land use and dispersal patterns at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, and that archaeological technocultural entities overlap in their fundamental climatic niche space. This overlap implies that changing tools forms cannot readily been seen as reflecting adaptations to changing climates.}

  abstract = {Neanderthals occupied Western Eurasia between 350~ka and 40~ka ago, during the climatically volatile Pleistocene. A key issue is to what extent Neanderthal populations expanded into areas of Western Eurasia and what conditions facilitated such range expansions. The range extent of Neanderthals is generally based on the distribution of Neanderthal material, but the land-altering nature of glacial periods has erased much of the already sparse material evidence of Neanderthals, particularly in the northern latitudes. To overcome this obstacle species distribution models can estimate past distributions of Neanderthals, however, most implementations are generally constrained spatially and temporally and may be artificially truncating the Neanderthal niche space. Using dated contexts from Neanderthal sites from across Western Eurasia, millennial-scale paleoclimate reconstructions, and a spatiotemporal species distribution model, we infer the fundamental climatic niche space of Neanderthals and estimate the extent of Neanderthal occupation. We find that (a.) despite the long timeframe, Neanderthals occupy a relatively narrow fundamental climatic niche space, (b.) the estimated projected potential Neanderthal niche space suggests a larger geographic range than the material record suggests, and (c.) that there was a general decline in the size of the projected potential Neanderthal niche from 145~ka ago onward, possibly contributing to their extinction.},

We used climatic variables characterizing the environmental conditions of MIS 5 ca. 120 to 80 kyr (averaged value) along with the topography and coordinates of Neanderthal and modern human archaeological sites to characterize the palaeodistribution of each species. Overlapping the models revealed that the Zagros Mountains were a contact and potential interbreeding zone for the two human species.

In practice, a number of methods can be used in predictive modelling, and the resulting maps of predicted site locations or density can vary in accuracy. The main difficulties in producing accurate and precise predictive models are coupled to the resolution and representativeness of the archaeological and non-archaeological datasets used, the theoretical frameworks underlying the models, and the nature, or lack, of model testing. Nonetheless, predictive models are often found useful to provide basic protection to areas of high sensitivity, and can save costs for development projects or archaeological investigations.},

Climate stability is quantified using annual trends and variabilities in air temperature and precipitation, and associated signal-to-noise ratios. Thresholds of natural variability in trends in regional- and global-mean temperature allow periods in Earth's history when climatic conditions were warming and cooling rapidly (or slowly) to be identified and climate stability to be estimated locally (grid-cell) during these periods of accelerated change.

The GBIF Backbone taxonomy also includes identifiers for Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) drawn from the barcoding resources iBOL and UNITE. International Barcode of Life project (iBOL), Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). BINs are connected to a taxon name and its classification by taking into account all names applied to the BIN and picking names with at least 80\% consensus. If there is no consensus of name at the species level, the selection process is repeated moving up the major Linnaean ranks until consensus is achieved. UNITE - Unified system for the DNA based fungal species, Species Hypotheses (SHs). SHs are connected to a taxon name and its classification based on the determination of the RefS (reference sequence) if present or the RepS (representative sequence). In the latter case, if there is no match in the UNITE taxonomy, the lowest rank with 100\% consensus within the SH will be used.

  abstract = {The random forest (RF) model is a powerful machine learning technique that has been increasingly used for species distribution modeling (SDM) by ecologists and fisheries scientists given various threats to marine habitats and biodiversity. However, the observations for model training are often constrained by limited surveys and financial resources. Under these circumstances, identifying the appropriate sample size for modeling is important for successful predictions. In addition, species with different biological characteristics present various challenges for SDM, which needs to be considered when evaluating model performance. We built and evaluated RF models for 21 marine demersal species using catch data and environmental variables collected during a bottom trawl survey in the coastal waters of Shandong Peninsula, China. The predictive performances of the RF models were evaluated for eight sample sizes using cross validation, in which a range of 10--80 sample sites were used to train the model. The resulting predictive performance was examined for a range of biological and behavioral traits. For most species, the predictive performance of the RF model was substantially improved when the sample size increased from 10 to 30 sites, but less improvement was evident with larger datasets. An ANOVA identified significant influences of migratory behavior, lifespan, body size, feeding mode and prevalence on the model predictability, whereas the effects of trophic level and taxon were insignificant, as were the interactions between the sample size and species traits. The abundance distributions could be better predicted for benthivores, and species with short migratory distances, short lifespans, and small body sizes, and for each species trait, the variation in the relative predictive performances of the trait categorical groups was generally consistent among sample sizes and performance metrics. Our study may contribute to an improved understanding of successful SDM and provide guidance for the application of RF models to predict the abundance distributions of fish species.}

The complex social, economic, and environmental landscapes in the region today are not new phenomena and understanding their interactions requires a nuanced, multidisciplinary understanding of the past. This review builds on a history of collaboration between the social and natural palaeoscience disciplines. We provide a multidisciplinary, multiscalar perspective on the relevance of past climate, environmental, and archaeological research in assessing present day vulnerabilities and risks for the populations of southwest Asia. We discuss the complexity of palaeoclimatic data interpretation, particularly in relation to hydrology, and provide an overview of key time periods of palaeoclimatic interest. We discuss the critical role that vegetation plays in the human?climate?environment nexus and discuss the implications of the available palaeoclimate and archaeological data, and their interpretation, for palaeonarratives of the region, both climatically and socially. We also provide an overview of how modelling can improve our understanding of past climate impacts and associated change in risk to societies. We conclude by looking to future work, and identify themes of ?scale? and ?seasonality? as still requiring further focus. We suggest that by appreciating a given locale's place in the regional hydroscape, be it an archaeological site or palaeoenvironmental archive, more robust links to climate can be made where appropriate and interpretations drawn will demand the resolution of factors acting across multiple scales.

It is argued that these concepts are too abstractly defined to enable meaningful insights into the dynamics of Early Neolithic societies. A different theoretical framework is needed in order to achieve an historical understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of regional socio-cultural interactions and population displacement. This framework begins with the detailed analysis of local patterns of social organization and exchange. Exchange itself is seen as a socially situated process that was integrally related to the negotiation and reproduction of collective identities during the Neolithic.},

  abstract = {The data distribution for plant domestication in the various parts of Anatolia is uneven and quite scarce or altogether missing for large tracts of the region. The Southeastern Taurus region and Central Anatolia provide a relatively good Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) archaeobotanical record, which is also the case, to a certain degree, for Central Anatolia. The rest of present-day Turkey, e.g., the northeast region, Cilicia, the Lake District and major parts of western Anatolia (the Black Sea, Mediterranean coast and Marmara regions) provide mostly Pottery Neolithic (PN) archaeobotanical data. The PN sites in these regions appear to represent Neolithic ``pioneer'' communities that established new sites based on an agricultural economy, of which none predate the second half of the 8th millennium cal. BC. Evidently, domesticated plants that first appeared in the Southeastern Taurus region ca. 8500~cal. BC spread rapidly to western Syria, Cyprus and Central Anatolia a couple of hundreds of years later (still within the second half of the 9th millennium cal. BC). It took another millennium for domesticates and agriculture to reach western Anatolia. While the growing intensity of Neolithic research throughout Turkey (western Turkey included) in recent years may change the picture, for now, based on the available data, this is the emerging pattern and it deserves thought. Based on evidence from a range of relevant disciplines (geobotany, archaeobotany, agronomy, genetics, archaeology and ethnobotany) we support a ``rapid'' model for plant domestication in Anatolia (as opposed to the ``protracted'' model). We reconstruct the diffusion of domesticates and the new economy in Turkey and into Europe via maritime routes and through the inland ``Anatolian Corridor.'' We offer itinerant farming craftsmen (``expert harvesters'') as a possible mechanism in the diffusion of agricultural products during the Neolithic.}

  abstract = {Wheat and barley are two of the founder crops of the agricultural revolution that took place 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent and both crops remain among the world's most important crops. Domestication of these crops from their wild ancestors required the evolution of traits useful to humans, rather than survival in their natural environment. Of these traits, grain retention and threshability, yield improvement, changes to photoperiod sensitivity and nutritional value are most pronounced between wild and domesticated forms. Knowledge about the geographical origins of these crops and the genes responsible for domestication traits largely pre-dates the era of next-generation sequencing, although sequencing will lead to new insights. Molecular markers were initially used to calculate distance (relatedness), genetic diversity and to generate genetic maps which were useful in cloning major domestication genes. Both crops are characterized by large, complex genomes which were long thought to be beyond the scope of whole-genome sequencing. However, advances in sequencing technologies have improved the state of genomic resources for both wheat and barley. The availability of reference genomes for wheat and some of its progenitors, as well as for barley, sets the stage for answering unresolved questions in domestication genomics of wheat and barley.},

In this article we present new archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data from Gusir H{\"o}y{\"u}k, an aceramic Neolithic habitation dating to the 12th-late 11th millennia cal BP. Our results show selective use of legume crop progenitors and nuts during the earlier part of this period, followed by the management of cereal and legume crop progenitors from the mid-11th millennium cal BP. This contrasts with data available from other Anatolian habitations indicating broad spectrum plant use with low crop progenitor inputs. Early aceramic Neolithic Anatolian plant and animal exploitation strategies were site-specific, reflecting distinctive identities and culinary choices rather than environmental constraints. A multivariate evaluation of wheat grain metrics alongside botanical and radiometric data indicate that early wheat domestication in southeast Anatolia occurred at a faster pace than predicted by current hypotheses for a protracted transition to farming in Southwest Asia. We argue that this phenomenon is best explained as a corollary of the increasing importance of cereals in feasting at southeast Anatolian sites characterised by increasing architectural complexity and elaboration during the 11th millennium cal BP.},

Understanding the geographical pattern of domestication may also assist in reconstructing the cultural processes underlying the Neolithic (agricultural) Revolution. Here we review prevailing views on the geographic pattern of Near Eastern plant domestication, and highlight the distinction between genetic domestication events and independent cultural events. A critical evaluation of the wealth of newly published geobotanical, genetic, and archaeological data provides strong support in favor of a specific core area in southeastern Turkey where most, if not all, founder Near Eastern crops were likely domesticated.}

Very soon after its formation, it spread globally from its cradle in the fertile crescent into new habitats and climates, to become a staple food of humanity. This extraordinary global expansion was probably enabled by allopolyploidy that accelerated genetic novelty through the acquisition of new traits, new intergenomic interactions, and buffering of mutations, and by the attractiveness of bread wheat's large, tasty, and nutritious grain with high baking quality. New genome sequences suggest that the elusive donor of the B subgenome is a distinct (unknown or extinct) species rather than a mosaic genome. We discuss the origin of the diploid and tetraploid progenitors of bread wheat and the conflicting genetic and archaeological evidence on where it was formed and which species was its free-threshing tetraploid progenitor. Wheat experienced many environmental changes throughout its evolution, therefore, while it might adapt to current climatic changes, efforts are needed to better use and conserve the vast gene pool of wheat biodiversity on which our food security depends.}

  abstract = {More than 12,000~years ago, with the beginning of the Neolithic Age, one of the most fundamental innovations in human history took place: the beginning of agriculture. The plants and animals that became an indispensable aspect of human life began to differ more and more from their wild relatives, and in the course of time, adaptive traits advantageous for living together with humans were fixed. The history of cultivated rye (Secale cereale subsp. cereale) has long been mysterious, and many theories have been put forward as to its origin. The putative wild progenitor Secale cereale subsp. vavilovii still occurs in Southwest Asia, as do the close relatives of rye, wheat and barley. But in contrast to the latter two species, rye was not used as a cereal crop until the European Bronze Age, several millennia after start of the Neolithic revolution. Hence, it is not among the founder crops of agriculture. Archaeobotanical studies, genetic kinship analyses as well as the cultural history and etymology support the hypothesis of a secondary domestication origin from a weed in wheat and barley fields. In northern and central Europe, its exceptional winter hardiness and its tolerance to grow on poor soils may have enabled it to be grown as a grain crop in its own right. Yet still, in some regions of the world, e.g. Southwest Asia, rye is considered a weed growing among other cereals. In this chapter, we review the current knowledge of the taxonomy of the small genus Secale, the basics of the Neolithic transition and the domestication of cereals, as well as the peculiarities of the cultural history of rye as a secondary domesticate collating evidence from multiple disciplines.},

Here, we systematically combine compositional and contextual evidence to recognise the wild plants for which there is strong evidence of their deliberate collection as food at pre-agricultural and early agricultural sites across southwest Asia. Through sample-by-sample analysis of archaeobotanical remains, a robust link is established between the archaeological evidence and its interpretation in terms of food use, which permits a re-evaluation of the evidence for the exploitation of a broad spectrum of wild plant foods at pre-agricultural sites, and the extent to which this changed during the development of early agriculture. Our results show that relatively few of the wild taxa found at pre- and early agricultural sites can be confidently recognised as contributing to the human diet, and we found no evidence for a narrowing of the plant food spectrum during the adoption of agriculture. This has implications for how we understand the processes leading to the domestication of crops, and points towards a mutualistic relationship between people and plants as a driving force during the development of agriculture.}

PaleoView is a new freeware tool, which provides a comprehensive but easy-to-use way to generate and view paleoclimate data at temporal and spatial resolutions suitable for detecting biotic responses to major climate shifts since the last glacial maximum. Regional to global scale simulations of temperature, precipitation, humidity and mean sea level pressure can be generated from PaleoView as gridded or time series data at time intervals as short as a decade for any period during the last 21 000 yr. They can be viewed using a built-in geographical user interface or saved as data files. Modelled climate reconstructions are based on daily simulation output from the Community Climate System Model ver. 3 (CCSM3). This global coupled atmosphere?ocean?sea ice?land general circulation model accurately reproduces major climatic features associated with the most recent deglaciation event, and predicts present-day patterns of climate conditions with verified hindcast skill. By providing a portal for readily accessing climate reconstructions at high temporal resolutions, PaleoView can help to better establish the consequences of past climate fluctuations on macro-ecological patterns of biological and genetic diversity.}

  abstract = {More than 10 years have passed since a number of publications presented evidence for the possible cultivation of wild cereals based on charred remains of potential arable weeds and spikelet bases from late Pleistocene/early Holocene sites in northern Syria. Since then, a number of publications concerning the beginnings of cultivation have appeared which used results from the Syrian sites. This paper was inspired by issues raised in these publications, which will be addressed through an empirical approach, first by discussing the possible techniques and methods used for sowing, harvesting and tilling at sites that produced remains of wild cereals and pulses with reference to experimental cultivation and field observations of wild cereal habitats. Secondly, taking into account the range of possible methods of exploitation demonstrates the complexity of distinguishing between the gathering and the cultivation of morphologically wild cereals and the probability that these two modes were practiced intermittently and interchangeably. In addition to this the inadequacy of evidence obtained from charred plant remains, suggests that the concept of ``predomestic'' cultivation as used for northern Syria needs to be revised. Thirdly, the causes of the varying proportions of shattering and non-shattering spikelets occurring together are examined and found to be multiple, suggesting that selection rates obtained from ratios of charred spikelet bases need to be reconsidered.},

Currently, updated archeological information points to two other centers of early cultivation, central Mexico and the middle Yangtze River in China, that led to the emergence of complex civilizations.4 However, the best-recorded sequence from foraging to farming is found in the Near East. Its presence warns against the approach of viewing all three evolutionary sequences as identical in terms of primary conditions, economic and social motivations and activities, and the resulting cultural, social, and ideological changes. {\copyright} 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

Most students of agricultural history regard livestock rising as part of agriculture. In modern usage agriculture is sometimes restricted to the cultivation of crops and excludes the raising of domestic animals, but more usually it implies both. The terms horticulture and gardening have also been used to denote systems of crop cultivation in some parts of the world, principally in Melanesia and the Pacific Islands that combine the growing of root and cereal crops in fields with the raising of tree, shrub and herbaceous crops in gardens. The term cultivation is even more general, and its usage is more varied, than either agriculture or domestication. Even the deliberate burning of vegetation to aid clearance, add nutrients to the soil, and promote the growth of useful plants can be regarded as within the scope of cultivation, most obviously in the context of swidden cultivation.},

The economic, social, technological, and ideological transformations immediately preceding and following these changes were profound. Early models of culture change associated with pre-agricultural societies of the Levant focused on the sudden, late origin of settled farming villages triggered by climate change. Accompanying this new economic and living situation was durable stone-built architecture; intensified plant and animal use; a flourishing of art and decoration; new mortuary traditions, including marked graves and cemeteries; elaborate ritual and symbolic behavior-a new way of life. This new life style arguably had a slow start, but really took off during the Epipaleolithic period (EP), spanning more than 10,000 years of Levantine prehistory from c. 23,000-11,500 cal BP. The last EP phase, immediately preceding the Neolithic, is by far the best-studied in terms of its cultural and economic contributions to questions on the origins of agriculture.1-4 Recently, archeologists have considered the earlier parts of the EP to be more culturally dynamic and similar to the later phase (Natufian) than was previously thought.3-10 The earlier EP is increasingly seen as demonstrating the behavioral variability and innovations that help us to understand the economic, technological, and social changes associated with complex hunter-gatherers of the Natufian and farmers of the Neolithic. This paper traces the cultural and biological developments of the EP period leading up to the Natufian and considers the long-term trajectory of culture change, social complexity, and village life in the Near East.}

While in 1995 there appeared to have been at least a 1,500-year gap between plant and animal domestication, it now seems that both occurred at roughly the same time, with initial management of morphologically wild future plant and animal domesticates reaching back to at least 11,500 cal BP, if not earlier. A focus on the southern Levant as the core area for crop domestication and diffusion has been replaced by a more pluralistic view that sees domestication of various crops and livestock occurring, sometimes multiple times in the same species, across the entire region. Morphological change can no longer be held to be a leading-edge indicator of domestication. Instead, it appears that a long period of increasingly intensive human management preceded the manifestation of archaeologically detectable morphological change in managed crops and livestock. Agriculture in the Near East arose in the context of broad-based systematic human efforts at modifying local environments and biotic communities to encourage plant and animal resources of economic interest. This process took place across the entire Fertile Crescent during a period of dramatic post-Pleistocene climate and environmental change with considerable regional variation in the scope and intensity of these activities as well as in the range of resources being manipulated.}

The resumption of investigations in the east in the early 2000s, coupled with new scientific methods for documenting agricultural emergence, has reestablished the region as a heartland of domestication of both crop and livestock species. This broad topic is covered in two papers, beginning here with the history of this work from the 1950s through the early 2000s.

In some cases, this involved the cultivation of taxa that would go on to be domesticated and form the foundation of future agricultural economies. However, many forms of plant use did not follow this trajectory, and in multiple places farming was only taken up later as an established `package' of crops and management practices. In this paper, we present new archaeobotanical evidence from the Early Neolithic site of Sheikh-e Abad in the central Zagros mountains of western Iran. Sheikh-e Abad is unique in being the only settlement known to date within southwest Asia that lies at an altitude above 1,000~m and which has occupation spanning the agricultural transition (9800--7600~bc). Thus, it provides a rare opportunity to examine pre-agricultural plant management strategies in an upland zone. Our analyses of the plant remains from Sheikh-e Abad suggest that from its earliest occupation the site's inhabitants were `auditioning' a group of locally available wild grasses, which ultimately were never domesticated. We discuss the possible reasons for this from a socio-ecological perspective, considering both the biology and ecology of the plant species in question, as well as the ways in which they were potentially managed.},

The model suggests little to no variation over time in the spatial extent of the potential area suitable for buckwheat cultivation. In the northern parts of China, the limits of the ecological niche largely fall within the borders of the study area, while to the west it never extends into the main Tibetan plateau, explaining the lack of fossil evidence from Central Asia. In the southwest, the niche overlaps with the borders of modern China, which supports this direction as a viable route of westward dispersal. The comparison between the prediction from the model and sites with archaeobotanical evidence for Fagopyrum indicates that the environmental niche it occupied remained stable over time. This may contrast with a dispersal pattern characterised by continuous adaptations to new environments facilitated by human activity, which may be suggested for other major and minor crops.},

However, there have been few archaeobotanical data to examine whether the early adoption of wild cereal cultivation and the subsequent appearance of domesticated-type cereals occurred in parallel across southwest Asia, or if chronological differences existed between regions. The evaluation of the available archaeobotanical evidence indicates that during Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) cultivation of wild cereal species was common in regions such as the southern-central Levant and the Upper Euphrates area, but the plant-based subsistence in the eastern Fertile Crescent (southeast Turkey, Iran, and Iraq) focused on the exploitation of plants such as legumes, goatgrass, fruits, and nuts. Around 10.7-10.2 ka Cal BP (early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B), the predominant exploitation of cereals continued in the southern-central Levant and is correlated with the appearance of significant proportions ({$\sim$}30\%) of domesticated-type cereal chaff in the archaeobotanical record. In the eastern Fertile Crescent exploitation of legumes, fruits, nuts, and grasses continued, and in the Euphrates legumes predominated. In these two regions domesticated-type cereal chaff ({$>$}10\%) is not identified until the middle and late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (10.2-8.3 ka Cal BP). We propose that the cultivation of wild and domesticated cereals developed at different times across southwest Asia and was conditioned by the regionally diverse plant-based subsistence strategies adopted by Pre-Pottery Neolithic groups.}

  abstract = {Abstract This paper debates claims that plant domestication occurred rapidly in a single restricted sub-section of the Near Eastern Fertile Crescent. Instead we argue for numerous parallel processes of domestication across the region in the Early Holocene. While a previous generation of genetic results seemed to support a single `core area', the accumulation of genetic evidence and refinements in methods undermine this, pointing increasingly towards multiple geographical origins. We stress that it is important to recognize that modern germplasm collections are an imperfect sample of the diversity of wild and cultivated populations of the past, which included some extinct lineages. We briefly synthesize the accumulated data from archaeobotany, defending the reliability of archaeological science to inform us about the past plant populations used by people. These data indicate an extended period of pre-domestication cultivation of at least a millennium and the slow evolution of morphological domestication adaptations in crop plants. The appearance of early cultivars and domesticates was spread piecemeal around the Near East, and a whole crop package is not evident. The `core area' claimed by some authors has no better claim for primacy or completeness in comparison to other parts of the Near East. Evidence from zooarchaeology similarly points towards a diffuse appearance of various domesticated animals. The `non-centric' appearance of domesticates from the Near East is therefore similar to the emerging evidence from many other regions of the world where plants were domesticated. We develop a hypothesis of why this should be expected given that anatomically modern human ancestors shared practices of vegetation management and planting, the necessary background knowledge for cultivation. Cultivation then was not a rare discovery but was a strategic and systematic shift in economies. The question then becomes why it was developed in the particular regions and periods where it appeared.}

An analysis of archaeobotanical data from 40 aceramic Neolithic sites in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe shows that there are vegetational signatures that characterize the different geographical regions occupied by the Early Neolithic farmers. On this basis it is argued that the compositional similarities of the crop package between the Levantine core, Cyprus, and Greece are indicative of both the routes of migration of early farming groups and the early agricultural practices of Europes first farmers.}

We interpret these changes as being partly caused by environmental factors, and partly caused by cultural reasons linked to the relatively rapid expansion of Linearbandkeramik (LBK) groups that inhibited diversification of crops until later in the Neolithic. , La diffusion de l'agriculture est examin{\'e}e ici en se basant sur les changements survenant dans la composition des ensembles arch{\'e}obotaniques. Une analyse multivariate est men{\'e}e sur une large base de donn{\'e}es consistant d'assemblages de plantes de sites du N{\'e}olithique ancien {\`a} travers l'Asie du sud ouest et l'Europe. Celle-ci t{\'e}moigne de modifications coh{\'e}rentes et significatives dans la composition de ces assortiments au cours du temps, g{\'e}n{\'e}r{\'e}es en grande partie par une r{\'e}duction de la diversit{\'e} des cultures. Nous interpr{\'e}tons ces changements comme {\'e}tant provoqu{\'e}s en partie par des facteurs environnementaux, et en partie par des facteurs culturels li{\'e}s {\`a} la relative rapidit{\'e} d'expansion des groupes {\`a} C{\'e}ramique Lin{\'e}aire, qui emp{\^e}chaient la diversification des cultures jusqu'{\`a} la fin du N{\'e}olithique. , ZusammenfassungDie Ausbreitung der Landwirtschaft wird hier aus der Perspektive von {\"A}nderungen in der Zusammensetzung arch{\"a}obotanischer Proben untersucht. Wir haben dabei die multivariate Analyse einer gr{\"o}{\ss}eren Datenbasis von Pflanzenfunden von neolithischen Fundpl{\"a}tzen zwischen S{\"u}dwestasien und Europa angewendet und zeigen, dass es im Laufe der Zeit zusammenh{\"a}ngende und bedeutsame {\"A}nderungen in ihrer Zusammensetzung gibt, was in gro{\ss}em Ma{\ss}e auf einer Reduktion der Artenvielfalt der Getreidesorten beruht. Diese Ver{\"a}nderungen werden von uns als teils durch Umweltfaktoren, teils durch kulturelle Gr{\"u}nde in Zusammenhang mit der pl{\"o}tzlichen Ausbreitung der linearbandkeramischen Gruppen interpretiert, was die Zunahme der Getreidearten auch bis in sp{\"a}tere Phasen des Neolithikums gehindert hat.},

Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience with modeling, this practical introduction shows data analysts, business analysts, and data scientists how the tidymodels framework offers a consistent, flexible approach for your work.RStudio engineers Max Kuhn and Julia Silge demonstrate ways to create models by focusing on an R dialect called the tidyverse. Software that adopts tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You'll understand why the tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of people.With this book, you will:Learn the steps necessary to build a model from beginning to endUnderstand how to use different modeling and feature engineering approaches fluentlyExamine the options for avoiding common pitfalls of modeling, such as overfittingLearn practical methods to prepare your data for modelingTune models for optimal performanceUse good statistical practices to compare, evaluate, and choose among models},

	abstract = {If we accept the evidence at face value, we are led to conclude that emmer was probably domesticated in the upper Jordan watershed and that einkorn was domesticated in southeast Turkey. Barley could have been domesticated almost anywhere within the arc bordering the fertile crescent. All three cereals may well have been harvested in the wild state throughout their regions of adaptation long before actual farming began. The primary habitats for barley, however, are not the same as those for the wheats. Wild barley is more xerophytic and extends farther downslope and into the steppes and deserts along the wadis. It seems likely that, while all three early cereals were domesticated within an are flanking the fertile crescent, each was domesticated in a different subregion of the zone.
Lest anyone should be led to think the problem is solved, we wish to close with a caveat. Domestication may not have taken place where the wild cereals were most abundant. Why should anyone cultivate a cereal where natural stands are as dense as a cultivated field? If wild cereal grasses can be harvested in unlimited quantities, why should anyone bother to till the soil and plant the seed? We suspect that we shall find, when the full story is unfolded, that here and there harvesting of wild cereals lingered on long after some people had learned to farm, and that farming itself may have originated in areas adjacent to, rather than in, the regions of greatest abundance of wild cereals.
We need far more specific information on the climate during incipient domestication and many more carefully conducted excavations of sites in the appropriate time range. The problem is far from solved, but some knowledge of the present distribution of the wild forms should be helpful.},
